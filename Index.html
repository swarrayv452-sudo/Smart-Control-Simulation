      <h2>About Smart Home</h2>
      <p>
        The Smart Home Control System is designed to make living spaces more
        efficient, comfortable, and secure. Our platform allows users to manage
        lighting, fans, air conditioners, and other appliances from a single,
        centralized dashboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether you’re in your office, at home, or on the go, Smart Home gives
        you real-time control and monitoring of your environment, promoting
        energy savings and convenience. With our system, you can automate
        everyday tasks, schedule device operations, and even monitor energy
        consumption across all rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our technology is built on the Internet of Things (IoT), connecting
        appliances and sensors through a secure network. Each connected device
        responds to user commands instantly, ensuring smooth and reliable
        performance whether accessed via desktop, tablet, or mobile phone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system is also designed with safety and efficiency in mind —
        allowing users to control air conditioners, control lighting intensity,
        monitor total power usage, and prevent overloads. With the addition of a
        master password, homeowners can control accessibility and privacy for
        every room in their smart environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, Smart Home Simulation combines comfort, innovation, and
        sustainability — empowering users to experience a truly connected home
        where energy, security, and convenience meet seamlessly.
